[Information About GreatSword-V3]

GreatSword-V3;SorrySecurly is a huge project ive been working on for months. Ive made an unblocker before called "RocketUnblocker;SorrySecurly" BUT, schools and blockers have quickly gain on to my level by shutting my Unblocker down by working with replit. But now ive spent months on this project making it IMPOSSIBLE to even penetrate. alot of the code is HTML. And if SOMEHOW or SOMEWAY this unblocker Gets Blocked, i can just repost it where as on rocketunblocker, replit turned there back on me and stopped anyone from using my unblocker.
